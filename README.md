This repository contains my implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using the powerful [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) framework. The project is built by following and expanding upon the excellent tutorials provided by **CampusX** on YouTube.

> RAG allows language models to access external data sources for more accurate and up-to-date responses by combining retrieval and generation in a seamless pipeline.
