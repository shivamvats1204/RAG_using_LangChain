By a river no one named, beneath the twilight's fold,
I walked where the grasses whispered truths the winds once told.
The sun had bowed behind the hills, its fire laid to rest—
But one small flame within my soul refused to be suppressed.

I asked the sky, “What calls me so, from dreams I’ve never known?”
The silence held me in its arms—more answer than was shown.
A heron rose on silver wings across the lotus tide,
Its shadow stitched the dusk with grace, no thought, no need to hide.

O unseen friend who walks with me, and never speaks aloud,
Who burns a lamp within my chest and hides it with a cloud—
You are the hush within my breath, the pause in every sigh,
The reason why my soul can kneel without a reason why.

Let others seek the golden crowns, the heights the world may give,
But leave to me the quiet path where unseen spirits live.
For I have heard the morning stars through leaves begin to sing—
And found in dew, a poet's voice, more royal than a king.
